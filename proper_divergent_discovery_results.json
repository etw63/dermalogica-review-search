            "this is a premium product with premium results. i get facials one a month or every two months, so i'm familiar with facial-like results, and this definitely delivers. the directions advise to start out by applying the peel every other day, but can be used daily. as with any exfoliating treatment, make sure to protect your skin with sunscreen and avoid sun exposure after. i like using this at night to be extra safe. in my experience, this peel is more gentle than the ordinary's 7% tonic solution and gave me glowier results. after leaving it on for a minute and rinsing after, my skin appeared softer, brighter, and more clear. very very impressed and happy with the results. i will be using this regularly! overall, if the product is within your budget or you want to splurge, i highly recommend the dermalogica liquid peelfoliant with glycolic acid. it's gentle, effective, and fast-working. [link](",

            "i'm 86 &amp; was concerned about this possibly being too strong for me however it was wonderful - no tingle, didn't feel it at all - left it on for about 10 minutes, my skin felt so soft &amp; silky after, rinses right off easily. very pleased!",
            "i really like this moisturizer. i have combo skin and during the summer in this texas weather i get oily. so to slap on a greasy sunscreen or moisturizer is no bueno. i really like this one though. its lightweight and non greasy. it slightly helps with oiliness but it's enough for me to use it. it also works great under makeup and doesn't seem to give off a white cast.",

            "this stuff is amazing! it is not aggressive and it has been clearing my skin and helping with any peeling i've had!!",
            "i\u2019ve been a fan of dermalogica products ever since beauty school in the 90\u2019s, and strictly using that brand for our treatments. you know you\u2019re getting something trusted by beauty therapists that will actually work. this is a small bottle of clear start by dermalogica (a new product range targeting the gen z age group. as long as it\u2019s got the dermalogica name on it, i\u2019m good with that. it contains both alpha hydroxy acids, and beta hydroxy acids, which are chemical peeling agents. they both work in different ways, but when used in conjunction can give you wonderfully clean, fresh, new skin, with not a dead skin cell in sight. alpha hydroxy acids (aha\u2019s) usually consist of glycolic, malic, lactic, citric, and mandelic acids. in this product there are lactic, mandelic, and azaleic acids, of which azaleic acid is less commonly known. it\u2019s used for treating acne and rosacea. beta hydroxy acids (bha\u2019s) generally consist of salycylic acid, and citric acid. these penetrate more deeply than aha\u2019s. they are oil soluble, whereas aha\u2019s are water soluble. bha\u2019s are good for treating deeper skin concerns such as blackheads or acne as they travel deeper into the skin, and remove excess oil aha\u2019s are more gentle, act on the surface, and are water soluble. they. can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, so you might want to wear a sunscreen. anyway, enough jumbo jumbo. how does it feel? well it definitely feels like it\u2019s doing something, as it tingles when it\u2019s on your skin. you can feel the dead skin dissolving! i only needed a few drops to cover my face and neck, and just the tingling feeling made me feel confident that yay, somethings working. i left it for just a few minutes on my 1st use, just in case of a reaction, or irritation, but i needn\u2019t have worried, i experienced no problems at all, it did not irritate my skin. my skin feels smooth and rejuvenated. on my 2nd use, i left it the full 10 minutes, and whilst i am probably not the typical target market for the product, because i don\u2019t have acne or blackheads, i do have aging, and wrinkly skin, and i know that aha\u2019s can help with this, and removing dead skin cells gives my other products a nice blank canvas on which to work. my skin feels great, hydrated, silky smooth, and though i can\u2019t really see any difference in my deep wrinkles, i can definitely feel a difference after using this. it just gives me so much confidence that my skin is looking good. and that it\u2019s as clean as it\u2019s ever going to get. i really like it, and i will get this again, as i feel it\u2019s a great price for a premium brand. [link](",
            "i've been struggling with maskne during this pandemic as i was working all through quarantine and wearing a mask 8 hours a day. this is the only moisturizer i've been able to wear. although it is not mattifying (i'd say it gives you a dewy finish), i don't have oily skin so it's not a problem for me. i rarely break out in this moisturizer and it's been my go-to when trying to avoid maskne.",
            "love how light this product is! i would recommend it to everyone. however it is supposed to help your face not be so oily and it still causes my face to become oily after putting it on! it has cleared up some of my scaring! love it and would buy it again.",
            "i use this every morning to wash my face",
            "i received this recovery system cream and mask complimentary from dermalogica. i really like it and how it moisturizes my skin. my skin is so bright and hydrated. the firmness is improved too. the quality is very good. i can highly recommend it to anyone to try it out. love!!!",
            "came back to the special cleaning gel after i stopped using it for a while. quickly realized why i stopped in the first place. this left my skin with some red bumps and redness after use. thought it might've been an adjustment and gave it the benefit of the doubt. but this was definitely leaving me with breakouts. left the skin dry after washing...very close to feeling stripped. made the skin feel 5x more oily, with an oily slick that reoccurred throughout the day.",
            "great skin care regime. it will surprise you of the amount of dirty that it gets out of your skin\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 helps keep lines and wrinkles out of your face",
            "i have sensitive combination skin, and i suffer from adult acne, so it was difficult to find a product that would control the acne without drying out my skin or causing a reaction. i was first introduced to dermalogica in a salon, and i loved it so much, i decided to pay the higher price for it. i use the active moist shown here, the skin clearing wash and the skin prep scrub. the cleanser is very mild, but it does a decent job mitigating the acne (although it doesn't prevent it entirely). the moisturizer is not too heavy, absorbs well, and does a good job keeping my skin soft. i never observe any dryness or flakiness on my face. the scrub feels nice, but i don't notice as significant a difference in my skin for better or worse when i use it. i suspect if i went without for awhile, i'd notice. i'll have to run that experiment and get back to you. still not sure the high price is worth it, but until i find a similar or better product that does the job, i'm sticking with it. [link](",
            "i use this face lotion everyday after my morning face wash. it is nice and creamy without being greasy. usually my face wash causes dry patches and i haven't had that issue since using dermalogica. it hasn't caused any irritations or breakouts and lasts all day!",
            "i've been using this for about 2 weeks. seems to be making a difference. we live in dry co and i was getting dry spots under my eyes which is why i bought this.",
            "this products removes all bacteria and guck from the skin, leaving it feeling fresh and smooth. i recommend using it when your skin gets more oily like during summer days. i've been using it for many years and it helped me clear out my little ingrown pimples.",
            "great product! i bought this to take the place of another glycolic acid product i had been using for a few years. i was really nervous about switching products but it has not disappointed!! my skin is very soft and smooth, and it did not turn my sensitive skin red or cause irritation. it's definitely a keeper.",
            "this was gifted by dermalogica, i have been using this for almost a week straight and love the hydration it gives as a gel moisturizer. i've been mixing this with a vitamin c serum/oil and am noticing a smoother texture on my cheeks. it is a little tacky at first which gives a nice glow but goes away after a little bit. it's worth trying if you need hydration and incorporate vitamin c into your routine.",
            "this has been a go to for me. if my skin looks \u201cdull\u201d after using this scrub by dermologica it looks renewed and bright again. one of the best skin care products to own in my opinion. i use a tiny amount 2-3 (or less) times a week and tube has lasted me a very long time!! it\u2019s a bit pricey compared to other products on amazon but well worth it. [link](",
            "after using this oil for about a week, i noticed my skin was clearing up. i had some hormonal acne around my chin and jaw, it was substantially less after using this oil. the oil is lightweight and sinks in well. it doesn't sit on top of the skin, or feel heavy. there is a light scent. i liked the design of the bottle, as well. the dropper was easy to use and controlled the amount of product needed.",
            "this oil feels so great on my skin, absorbs so easily and i wake up with a glow! love it and it'll stay part of my nighttime routine.",
            "love this oil! i've gone through a couple bottles and it really makes a difference. i wake up with soft glowing skin and have noticed an improvement in my skins texture as well.",
            "the oil is absolutely amazing. super lightweight. leaves skin feeling extremely soft and radiant in the mornings. all you have to do is place a little on after washing your face and you wake up to clearer more radiant skin. i love this oil",
            "i tried this product two ways. i used it in place of a moisturizer, and also on top of my regular daily moisturizer. i think in the summertime, an additional moisturizer would not be needed. this has a pleasant scent that isn't as strong as most sunscreens. i liked the feel of my skin after appying, and it didn't seem to affect my makeup application. it's still cold where i live, so i don't know how effective this is as a sunscreen, but i will definitely keep using this through the spring and summer. i would recommend this to anyone who needs a light, facial moisturizer and sunscreen that isn't thick or sticky.",
            "smoothing this on after a good face wash was like a breath of fresh air. it left my skin soft and glowing! i love that it has spf in it to protect my skin. i have already recommended it to my family and friends!",
            "i was surprised. the product seems oil-based, but it did help moisturize and clear-up my skin. [link](",

            "until this purchase, i have only had positive experiences with dermalogica products. that being said, i would not purchase this product again. the formula is very messy and stinks like baby vomit. i should add that i am unsure about the integrity of the product since the safety seal was only on the top of the box; the bottom of the box could easily be opened. also, when i opened the product cap, there was no seal. [link](",
            "its ok... it definitely was not matte and left my very oily skin extra greasy whenever i was in hot environments. however when inside it wasnt horrible for my skin. i wasnt too fond of the sunscreen scent in it though",

            "i received this product as a free sample. this stuff is great! noticeable results after one use. you have to let it dry completely before you go to bed or your face may feel a bit sticky when you lay down on your pillow. otherwise, this cream works great. face feels smoother in the morning.",

            "i started using dermalogica's multivitamin recovery cream recently, and i have to say, i'm really impressed. my skin feels so much smoother, and those little fine lines that have been creeping up around my eyes? they're definitely less noticeable. i love how it's rich but doesn't feel too heavy, and it gives my skin this healthy, refreshed glow by morning. gifted by dermalogica.",
            "such a great sunscreen, very moisturizing and it doesn't leave my skin white. it's great by itself and i also applied this product and put makeup on afterwards. the foundation doesn't flake off which shoes this sunscreen is a good base. haven't noticed anything about fine lines. i was gifted by dermalogica to give my honest review.",
            "from the first use, i've been so impressed with this overnight cream gifted by dermalogica. it's super hydrating and makes my skin feel refreshed and bright in the morning. the skin under my eyes tend to be sunken and dark when i wake. but after using this cream, they are much brighter as well. i love these features on top of helping my hyperpigmentation and skin texture!",
            "gifted by dermalogica. this product is very lightweight and very hydrating. i have only used it for a few days so not sure about the results but my skin has liked it so far and has not had any sort of negatives to my skin which is a good sign that will work with my sensitive skin.",
            "the cost is repulsive but the effects were obvious within days. i had already been on a fairly dedicated skincare regimen for quite some time but this really took things up a notch from a plateau i had reached. my fine lines on forehead and crows feet were never too severe, but now they're nearly imperceptible. i'll save my allowance and make sure i have enough to get another bottle when it's time :)",

            "i am very impressed with the results i'm already seeing in just a few short weeks of use. my fine lines, large pores and skin texture have improved enough that others are noticing too. i found it to be lightweight and gentle. i was concerned because it is a high dose retinol but i had no irritation. a little also goes a long way. definitely recommend. gifted by dermalogica",
            "this stuff is pure gold! i suffer from dark circles and have for years, i can already notice a difference in the two short weeks i've used it. i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a brightening serum. i received this product complimentary from dermalogica (ulta team)",
            "i always have a spot here and there when using traditional drugstore facial washes. this is professional quality that truly leaves your skin glowing. i would even say this is equivalent to going to get a facial done by an esthetician. in fact, an esthetician recommended this specific product for me. this brand is amazing if you're also looking for face masks. plus, it lasts months and months! you will not be wasting your money. i promise. [link](",
            "the dermalogica biolumin-c protector is a great product with multiple active ingredients that cover different skin concerns. i love that it is a moisturizer as well as an antioxidant packed product and to top it off it provides sun protection. this is a great product if you dont have a budget to purchase three separate products.",
            "i have worked @ ulta for a couple years now & have tried many serums. this is amazing. so nourishing & hydrating. this product does bring your skin life. @ night really work the product by pressing in post double cleanse and exfoliation will give you max benefits. in the morning press again after rinsing or cleansing the face. lots of people are turned off by the price but you do get what you pay for and you are literally getting two serums in one & a product that is very clean and works.",
            "i love dermalogica products and this set does not disappoint. this is a perfect set if you are on the fence and want to try it. also works great as a travel set. the cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated. it does not irritate my skin. i can\u2019t really pin point the scent but it doesn\u2019t bother me and i barely smell it. the serum is probably my favorite out of the 3 samples. it applies really nicely on my skin. it leaves it soft and makes my skin feel smooth. the moisturizer is a great finishing touch. it keeps my skin hydrated all night. i wake up in the morning with my skin looking brighter and awake. all three are a great combination for brighter and smoother skin. [link](",
            "after a week, my skin in noticeably smoother and brighter. i am noticing a minor breakout i didnt have prior, but my skin can be sensitive to vitamin c. all in all, i\u2019m going to continue to enjoy my glowing skin!",

            "if you\u2019re not using a retinol what are you even doing with your skin? i\u2019ve used retinols before but this one (gifted by dermalogica - sephora) is a new fav. this product has been so good for my acne, skin tone, and texture. definitely make sure you\u2019re protected from the sun while you get used to it! but it\u2019s so worth it!",
            "i am 27 and am having issues with some lines on my forehead and skin texture. ive used it tight and my lines are gone from my forehead. after using this my skin feels nice and tight, and the glow is unreal. 10/10 worth every penny!",
            "i received this product gifted by dermelogica. it's another amazing addition to their line up. the biolumin-c heat aging protector spf50 really seems to help plbrighten my skin but protect it from heat and the spf50 is a huge bonus! it even seems to help lighten sun spots. overall, i'm a fan!",
            "i love and live for this serum. it\u2019s so expensive but worth it. maybe i\u2019m crazy. it looks to me like buying 2.5 ounces is $78 and it equals an ounce 30 ml but if you just buy the 1 ounce it\u2019s $99\u2026. so i guess i\u2019m gonna buy two mini. save over $39",
            "i\u2019m on my second bottle of this and it has definitely helped even skin tone and tame hormonal breakouts. i use it twice a day religiously, and while the price tag to me seems high it worked enough for me to buy it again.",
            "i don't know if its just me, but i break out badly using this serum. i had high expectations for this serum considering the price and all the good reviews via word of mouth and online. i do not notice any difference after using it for a month now. will continue using my powerbright dark spot serum instead as it works much better for my skin. i get microneedling done and the powerbright works much better after treatment.",
            "i ordered my first bottle of dynamic skin retinol serum &amp; i was disappointed at the small amount of product - i'm thinking that the container was not filled to the correct level because pushing on the dispenser the first night there was air and not a continuous amount of serum :( this is my first negative experience with a dermalogica product",
            "i've been using this serum for just over a month and am seeing results in the lightening of the spots on my face. i use it am and pm most days, but, definitely pm so it has the evening to work. bottom line, it has worked for me as i can see my spots getting lighter and as i have fair skin i appreciate this. complimentary from dermalogica.",
            "i received this complimentary from dermalogica and i'm glad that i did since it's not greasy and is safe for pregnant/breastfeeding moms. this powerbright overnight cream gives my fave a brightening boost which i need as a new mom.",
            "i have been using this serum for over a month. i bought the trial size and have since upgraded. it works wonder to brighten your skin. does not clear all acne but does a great job overall. deducted one star as it's very pricey. i will continue to use",
            "i love this product! it smells amazing\u2014 very relaxing. perfect right before bed. leaves my face so soft. my face looks and feels great in the morning.",
            "i tried dermalogica smart response serum..i truly loved this product..it has my skin bright and glowing..my skin is soft and smooth..it works great for lighting dark spots..i noticed this change in a week..i am very impressed with this product and i recommend trying it",
            "i've been using this product for about a week so far. i have acne prone skin and it hasn't caused me any new breakouts or issues. i have noticed my skin is brighter since using this. it goes on easily, absorbs quickly so i can go straight to my next product..doesn't leave a sticky residue either. the price is kind of expensive compared to other vitamin c products though.",
            "i received this from influesnter for free to review for my honest opinion , it is so amazing and love the texture of this product , doesn't make your skin feel dewy , it is light on my face , really impressed with the results of this product , my skin looks brighter , highly recommend this !",
            "the sticker shock on that price tag is real but little goes a long way! i use this only on the areas of my face that are affected during dermatitis flareups (for me this is my cheeks and temples) and it's consistently one of the few products that doesn't sting or make the redness and discomfort worse. i'll keep purchasing this as long as it's available, it's really a game changer.",
            "i got serum in july '23 when it was on sale, and its the best sale product ive gotten from ulta thus far. its reduced my dark spots and fine lines, my skin is def healthier!",
            "i've been using this for about a month. i alternate this with retinol at night. works great for my combo, acne-prone skin! i stopped using it for a week to try a different product. i've since learned just how helpful this product has been for keeping blemishes away, making my pores less noticeable, and clearing up milia. a little goes a long way!",
            "i love the consistency of the gel, it has a pleasant citrusy scent to my nose. this foams into a nice lather quickly. i don\u2019t need to use more than a pea sized amount. overall only been using it for a week so far i like it alot.",
            "it\u2019s okay.. for $63 i don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. i have dry acne prone skin and it feels nice on the face for the first hour or so but it doesn\u2019t give you any extra hydration or moisture. it\u2019s just a regular moisturizer and it definitely should not cost 63$.",
            "i am very upset. we ordered 2 x active moist 3.4 fl oz and received 2x age smart multivitamin thermafolient 2.5 fl oz. how can this happen? even the sticker label says active moist. and i have no chance of returning this. let me rephrase my opening statement... i am livid. i can not use this stuff and i also didn\u2019t order it. you (as in the seller) need to fix this! [link](",
            "i really liked the product in that it had a pleasant smell and was very rich and moisturizing. i have had other products that were about as good though. on top of that the one bottle only lasted me about a month. i would say it isn\u2019t worth it for $60 a month. [link](",
            "the price tag had me scared for a long time, but i finally pulled the trigger and bought this after a new skin routine broke me out and irritated my skin so bad. i'm using this in addition to other products, but i definitely feel the difference from using this one. you don't need a ton of product to get a nice emulsified foam and it's so gentle and non-stripping. my face feels so soft and smooth after using it and lasts all day. i really feel like it's helped my toners and moisturizers penetrate deeper too. i really love this and will definitely repurchase!",
            "this product was recommended to me by the kind woman who did my facial! i was given a sample of this and loved how light it was and didn't make me super oily since i am more of an oily skin. i bought the travel size but even the travel size was very pricey! i have to save a lot just for this",
            "best way to start your beauty routine for smoother, softer, clean face",
            "this cleanser was gifted by dermalogica. its a pretty basic cleanser but it does help brighten the skin a little. i wear makeup basically everyday and i use micellar water and an oil cleanser to get that off. this usually means that my skin is left a little dry and leftover makeup gets caught on small dry patches. after using this cleanser, my skin feels smoother, brighter, and softer. i don't think pictures do it justice, but i do think this cleanser removes impurities and creates a clean canvas for the next day. i recommend it if you're looking to try a new cleanser. i also recommend to anyone who is trying to fight dullness. make sure you use sunscreen in the morning!",
            "too much of a yellow base for me.",
            "if you have sensitive skin make sure you only use this once or twice a week only. your face will get a little red but it goes away within an hour.",
            "i am one that never leaves reviews, wether good or bad. however, this product is amazing!!! don't let the price scare you (i know it did to me), it's worth the price! i only have two weeks using it and my skin looks way better. using a mask at work really broke out my skin and left horrible scaring, this oil has cleared my skin by more that 80%. i have oily, combination skin don't be scared by it being oil, it does wonders.",
            "i\u2019ve been using the cream for around a month now. i have extremely sensitive and trouble-prone skin and many (most!) moisturizers make me break out or leave my skin feeling like an oil slick. so, this product had its job cut out for it, and it came through. things that i really loved about it include: +fairly lightweight but still feels creamy and substantial +feels incredibly nice on the skin as you rub/pat it in +absorbs very quickly +didn\u2019t leave any residue, was able to apply makeup within minutes. +worked almost like a primer \u2013 it helps my makeup last longer. +didn\u2019t cause acne \u2013 in fact, i have less chin acne than before +i have less t-zone redness the only thing i consider a drawback is the construction of the bottle. it is hard to know when you're getting to the bottom and need to replace it because you can't see through the bottle. other than that, i have nothing but great things to say. the price is high, but it's what you would expect from high-end premium quality skin care products. for glowing and youthful skin (a couple people have recently complimented me on my glowing skin!!) it's an investment i consider well worth it. [link](",
            "ok - so i love this, but they need to repackage this and sell under a normal serum as the foaming part is nonexistent. i own two of these bc i like the brightening and lightening of my dark spots but the foam of course doesn't work and hasn't since the first use so it's a messy mess to use on my face each morning as i squeeze the nozzle directly on my face and let the liquid leak on to it and rub in from there. again - very good at lightening hyperpigmentation and acne spots, but not a foaming liquid like they advertise.",
            "my skin is really sensitive, i suffer from bacterial acne and the pandemic has really made that worse. i started using this a month ago and my face has never been this clear. it has really helped with my complexion as well [link](",
            "it made my pores clear no my face is more bright.",
            "the serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly without any tacky feeling. i do feel my skin brightening after a few uses but it is too early to comment on fading dark spots. i like the pump packaging and the ease of use. the only thing i didn't like was the fragrance. it is quite off-putting and lingers. the highlighted ingredient hexylresorcinol at 0.5% is supposed to give the same results as 2% hydroquinone which is amazing. not sure what % of hexylresorcinol is used here but it seems really promising and i am excited to continue using it and seeing results. complimentary from dermalogica.",
            "i got this as part of a kit for reducing skin pigmentation. used all three products religiously and saw no difference",
            "it does brighten up my face after just a few days of using it. i use it with dermalogica's skin smoothing cream",
            "i've used this brand before and i know their face care products are pretty nice. this is a travel set. very small. products are nice but the price point is not friendly. [link](",
            "this moisturizer was gifted by dermalogica. i loved the way this moisturizer smelled and the way it glided across my skin. it was so hydrating for my dry skin type. i did observe my skin tone to be brighter overall after weeks of usage. while the texture was lightweight it did offer a high amount of spf protection without leaving a white cast. my only issue with the moisturizer was i felt that when i used it on my face, it made it kind of shiny and made my pores appear more prominent.",
            "do not purchase if you have sensitive/ acne prone skin type. this product is heavily fragranced and caused irritation and breakouts on my face. after using for two weeks i thought it was bettering my face but it only caused it to worsen.",
            "this combined with the murad invisiscar for 1 year completely changed my 20 year old acne scars. so happy with the results...i was shocked!",
            "i debated this purchase as it is pricey but i am glad i did! with patience and consistency it has improved the texture around my mouth and lower cheeks. i've begun using it just prior to my home red light treatment too. i believe it improves the absorption.",
            "the calm water gel moisturizer is great. it is benefiting my skin causing no break out or worsening rosacea/redness. i do feel like it requires much more product than others, so a little doesn't necessarily go a long way here, only downside.",
            "i have very reactive skin with rosacea and rosacea-based acne. i find that skincare products will work for a while on my skin, then i'll have breakthrough flareups that mean i need to switch products yet again. this is the latest moisturizer i've been using, and it works really well. it has calmed the redness and irritation considerably, reduced the acne-type areas i get during flareups, and despite how rich it is, it isn't clogging pores or causing any other kinds of acne. my only complaints are the price for how much is actually in the bottle, and not being able to see how much is actually left. i went through the first bottle in no time, and thankfully had another on order the day i ran out.",
            "dermalogica age bright clearing serum is a game changer for having a clear and bright skin. i have occasional acne breakouts and left over scars from acne and i am also fighting with aging signs on my skin. i have a combination skin and this serum suited me well. its a clear serum with water consistency.i have incorporated it in my morning and night routine along with another treatment serum and it has proved to be great. i am observing visible effects on my skin with more brighter, glowy, clear and softer skin. it has salicylic acid that helps to reduce breakouts. niacinamide helps in improving hydration status. overall this is another great product by dermalogica that can't be missed of you want to have a great skin.",
            "your product is best best i use it and my skin make brigter day by day love dermalogica products",
            "i was skeptical to buy this product just because it\u2019s so expensive but my daughter (who is an esthetician) recommenced this particular brand. i must say that it works wonders. i have a little melasma on my upper lip from some medication i took a while ago and i am so self conscious about it. after 2-3 uses, i definitely could tell it was getting lighter. i will order this again. [link](",
            "i bought the $45 kit that included the daily microfoliant, age serum, and spot fader. this serum has actually done as described and my combination skin has been under control since my first use 8 weeks ago. i used to have at least three different products i'd put on my face each night but i don't need anything else but this and the spot fader! my combination skin is so balanced that i don't even need moisturizer, even coming into fall/winter where my chin gets blotchy dry patches and so far no sign of anything! my stubborn forehead lines are much less visible also. leaving a review since i'm about to purchase my full size bottle--its worth the extra few bucks for something that really works",
            "this is exactly what my skin needed! i struggle with acne and dark spots and within a few uses my skin was already noticeably brighter! i love how easy it is to use and i only use a little bit so i know it will last me a while! my skin doesn\u2019t feel irritated or dry after using it either. it\u2019s such a perfect product for anyone with dark spots!",
            "i was gifted by dermalogica this cleanser and it is great! i was amazed at the fact that this even helps to clean out accumulated pollution on the skin! my skin is getting brighter and smoother thanks to this!",
            "this product was gifted by dermaologica. the formulation of this cream is absolutely top-tier. the ingredient list is incredible, so many brightening and skin tone evening ingredients paired together. to list a few we have vitamin c, niacinamide, hexylresorcinol and pumpkin enzyme. after using this cream at night, i woke up with brighter skin, that felt moisturized and plump. i really enjoy creams like this, because as your skin is resting at night, it also can be working hard to treat things like hyper pigmentation and acne scarring. it has a nice soft texture and it doesn't sit heavy on my skin. overall it makes me look and feel luminous and i really enjoy this cream."

            "im a huge fan of dermalogica and i wasnt surprised when this gel didn\u2019t disappoint. i use it every day after triple cleansing by the same brand products. it feels amazing during application and leaves my skin moisturized. with my tret skin, this is a huuuge deal!!",
            "it was so good feels clean when you apply i. when you wake up in the mornings and u apply it, it makes your skin glow and soft definitely recommend it to anyone who wants clear and nice skin. so happy with the results gifted by dermalogica",
            "expect to fall in love with this cleansing gel, daily exfoliant, and skin smoothing cream. i found the precleanse unnecessary. however, this is the benefit of a set such as this. you can find what works for you and what doesn't. the daily exfoliant (i use it about 3 times per week) is perfect as you can make it the consistency you wish. it does take a bit getting used to, but i really enjoy using it. i would also say the skin smoothing cream is one of my favorites. it is perfect for my combination skin and i have already purchased a full-sized tube. thank you for helping me find skincare to help me have healthy-looking skin!",
            "the texture is luxurious and feels like a treat for my skin. it removes my makeup and impurities without leaving my face feeling stripped or dry, which is a huge plus. i'm here for its magnetic technology, which seems to cleanse deeply while still being gentle. my skin feels refreshed and has a nice, very subtle glow. i also love that it's free from harsh chemicals, making it suitable for my sensitive skin. gifted by dermalogica",
            "i think the gel is the best item in the trio, though i am happy with all of the items. the gel is like a drink of water to the skin. this is good because it calms stressed out skin without being an irritation. it also worked well under foundation.",
            "these products are fantastic. i was a little worried about a four-part system, but gave it a try and am very pleased with the results. it's refreshing and hydrating and i notice a difference in my skin - it looks and feels healthier. i also have sensitive skin and these products are very gentle on it. i'm impressed and will continue using them.",
            "i really love how this product left my skin. it didn't make my skin feel drier like others. i really love the skin smoothing cream, it made my skin feel smooth all day. this takes longer because there are more steps but i enjoyed it and would recommend this. i just needed a small amount of the precleanse and the special cleansing gel otherwise it would have been a lot on my face. i like that you mix the daily microfoliant.",
            "i\u2019m a big fan of sets that provide both cleansers and exfoliators since i suffer from very dry skin and need that regular exfoliation. initial thought after using the set\u2014the products are all very gentle and do not cause any reaction with my skin (i have sensitive skin and a lot of products cause my face to turn red and splotchy). the smell is also minimal and pleasant. i like the texture of the precleanse, it doesn\u2019t feel as oily (aka super runny) as other cleansing oils. no complaints about the cleansing gel or exfoliator (i love powder exfoliators bc i can control the density product!). doesn\u2019t make my face feel super tight after using. favorite product is probably the moisturizer, it\u2019s thick (but not to thick) so it feels like your face is really soaking up the hydration long after application. it also doesn\u2019t leave your face feeling greasy! i received this product from bzzagent in exchange for my honest review.",
